## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Axios for API requests

### Backend
- Python Flask for yield prediction and crop recommendation models
- Node.js for chatbot functionality
- Machine Learning models (Random Forest) for agricultural predictions


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend services)
- Git

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/toshankanwar/agroLens.git
cd AgroLens/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
### Backend Setup
```base
# Setup Yield Prediction Service
cd ../backend/yield_prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Setup Recommendation Service
cd ../recommendation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

```


### Development
# To run the project in development mode:
```base
# Frontend (from frontend directory)
npm run dev

# Access the application at http://localhost:5173
```

### Deployment
## Vercel Deployment Notes
To ensure proper functioning of client-side routing when deployed to Vercel, the project includes a vercel.json configuration file that redirects all routes to the main index.html file:

```base
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This configuration prevents 404 errors when refreshing pages or accessing routes directly.
